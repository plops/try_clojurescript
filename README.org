* synopsis:
  - i want to develop interactively in the browser
  - clojurescript seems nice enough
  - calva in visual studio code has paredit and jump to definition,
    might just be able to replace my normal common lisp/slime/emacs
    dev environment
  - i have trouble setting up the dependencies and i have no good
    overview over the possible solutions yet, ideally i want to have a
    minimal setup with only clj
    - clojurescript has a lot of tools for that
      - leiningen, boot are apparently old
      - clj manages dependencies for clojure and clojurescript, it is
        actually used to install clojurescript
      - clj-new can generate projects from templates
      - deps-new (author of clj-new suggests to use that)
