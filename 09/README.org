- the key bindings for paredit are a bit different in vs code compared
  to emacs. i'm particular confused about 'Barf Backward' (which is
  C-right in emacs and C-M-> here) and yanking the rest of the
  s-expression (C-k in emacs. It clears in vs code but I can't paste
  it later)

shift+backspace (on Mac) 	Delete Forward, unless it will unbalance a form
ctrl+alt+backspace 	Force Delete Backward
